# src/services/ — data, business logic, lifecycle

All polling, file watching, network calls, keychain I/O, and rate-limiting live here. Each service is an `EventEmitter` singleton exported as a `const` at the bottom of its file (e.g. `quota.ts:351`, `accounts.ts:285`). Actions consume snapshots; they do not own state.

## The three data sources

1. **Local telemetry** — `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl` (live session transcripts), tailed by `activeSession.ts` to surface the active model. Separately, `attention.ts` tails `~/.claude/siestadeck/attention.jsonl`, which Claude Code **hooks** (installed into `~/.claude/settings.json` by the Attention action's key press) append their stdin payload to — capped at 2 KB/line; truncated lines are recovered by the regex fallback in `attentionPolicy.ts`. Verified empirically: permission dialogs, AskUserQuestion, and plan approval all emit `Notification` with `notification_type: "permission_prompt"`; `PreToolUse` fires *before* the permission dialog, so the post-approval un-block comes from `PostToolUse` or `Stop`.
2. **OS credential store** — abstracted by `credentialStore.ts`. On macOS, the `Claude Code-credentials` keychain entry is what Claude Code itself reads; `siestadeck-token-<slug>` is the per-account stash this plugin maintains via `security(1)`. On Windows, the active credentials live in `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (read by `keychain.ts`) and per-account stashes are DPAPI-encrypted files under `%APPDATA%\siestadeck\creds\` (via PowerShell `ProtectedData.Protect/Unprotect`). Service constant `CLAUDE_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE` and the per-account prefix `siestadeck-token` are defined in `keychain.ts:3` and `accounts.ts:14`.
3. **Anthropic OAuth** — undocumented `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` and `/profile` endpoints, both requiring `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. See `quota.ts:9,66` and `accounts.ts:218-222`.

## Lifecycle: eager vs lazy

| Service | Mode | Started in | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accountsService` | eager | `plugin.ts` | Must be ready before any action queries it. |
| `quotaRegistry` | eager (timers off by default) | `plugin.ts` | Per-account state needs to exist; the network polling itself is opt-in. |
| `activeSessionService` | **lazy** | `acquire(id)` from any action that needs it | Tails JSONL files; spinning up a watcher for a key the user never displays is wasteful. |
| `attentionService` | **lazy** | `acquire(id)` from the Attention action | 1s tail-poll of the hook events file + 10s settings.json install check; rotates the file at 1 MB (rename + grace-window drain). |

Lazy services use **reference-counted consumers**: the watcher starts on the first `acquire()` and stops when the last consumer `release()`s. See `activeSession.ts`. `releaseAll()` exists for the device-disconnect path in `plugin.ts`.

## Quota refresh policy (the non-obvious part)

`QuotaRegistry` (`quota.ts:128-349`) enforces several layers of rate-limiting. **Do not bypass these** — Anthropic's endpoint will 429 you and the plugin's UX depends on the backoff being respected:

- **5-second floor per account** (`MIN_REFRESH_GAP_MS`, `quota.ts:13,184`) — calls to `refresh(slug)` within 5s of the last attempt return the cached snapshot instead of hitting the network. Coalesces rapid PI fiddling and double-presses.
- **429 backoff: 1→10 minutes** (`MIN_BACKOFF_MS`, `MAX_BACKOFF_MS`, `quota.ts:11-12,191-201`) — a 429 sets `backoffUntil`. Refreshes during the cooldown re-emit a snapshot with the wait time so actions can render a "WAIT Xs" countdown without touching the network.
- **Idle gating** (`quota.ts:14,243-244`) — auto-refresh ticks check `isClaudeIdle(20min)` against `~/.claude/projects/` mtime (`idle.ts`). If Claude Code itself hasn't been active in 20 minutes, the auto tick is skipped. Manual `refresh()` calls are unaffected.
- **Auto-refresh is opt-in.** No timers run until `enableAutoRefresh(slug, ms)` is called. Cadence is clamped to ≥5 minutes (`quota.ts:234`).
- **Wake handling: `markAwake()` only clears the 5s coalesce window** (`quota.ts:281-283`). It does **not** auto-fetch — the user has to press a key after sleep. This is intentional: laptops resume into all sorts of network states.

## Multi-account architecture

`accountsService` (`accounts.ts`) maintains a registry on disk at `~/.config/siestadeck/accounts.json` plus per-account credential stashes in the keychain.

- **Adoption on first run** (`accounts.ts:98-143`) — if Claude Code is already logged in to an account the plugin hasn't seen, copy those creds into a new account slug (using the email prefix as the display name) so the user doesn't have to re-auth.
- **New-login polling** (`accounts.ts:160-197`) — Login/Logout action spawns a Terminal running `claude auth login`; this method polls the keychain entry every 2s for ≤3 min, adopts whatever lands, emits `changed`. Used because there's no other signal that the OAuth flow finished.
- **Atomic swap** (`accounts.ts:237-248`) — `swap(slug)` reads the stashed creds for `slug`, writes them into `Claude Code-credentials` (the entry Claude Code reads), updates the registry, emits `changed` + `swapped`. The keychain `add-generic-password -U` flag overwrites in place, so Claude Code never sees an empty/inconsistent state.

## Credential store (`credentialStore.ts`, `keychain.ts`)

`credentialStore.ts` defines the `CredentialStore` interface and selects an implementation by platform:

- **macOS** — `security find-generic-password -w` / `add-generic-password -U`. The `-U` (update) flag is what makes account swaps atomic. Don't replace with a Node keytar binding — `security(1)` is universal across macOS versions and has zero install footprint.
- **Windows** — PowerShell shell-out to `[System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData]::Protect/Unprotect` under `CurrentUser` scope. Encrypted blobs live as one file per credential under `%APPDATA%\siestadeck\creds\<sha1(service__account)>.bin`. No native module needed; a per-process in-memory cache amortizes the ~150–300 ms PowerShell spawn cost.

`keychain.ts` is the higher-level layer: `readClaudeCredentials()` / `snapshotClaudeCredentials()` / `writeClaudeCredentials()` know about each platform's location for the **active** Claude Code credential (Keychain entry on macOS, `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on Windows). `readGenericPassword` / `writeGenericPassword` are thin pass-throughs to `credentialStore` and are what `accounts.ts` uses for the per-account stashes.

## Adding a new service

1. Extend `EventEmitter`, export as a singleton at the bottom of the file.
2. Decide eager or lazy. If lazy, implement `acquire(id)` / `release(id)` / `releaseAll()` exactly like `activeSession.ts`.
3. Define a `Snapshot` type. Compute a fingerprint string and short-circuit emits when nothing meaningful changed (`activeSession.ts:202-204`).
4. `unref()` every timer and watcher so the plugin host can exit cleanly.
5. Register subscriptions or eager start in `src/plugin.ts`. Wire device-disconnect / device-connect handlers if the service should suspend when no Stream Decks are visible.
